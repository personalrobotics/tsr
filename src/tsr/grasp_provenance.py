"""Structured, machine-readable provenance for generated grasp templates.

Clause 8 of the geometric grasp contract (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, issue #66)
requires that every template a factory returns declares its grasp mode
*structurally* — tests and oracles read this record, never parse the
human-readable ``name``.

**Provenance declares intent; the generated pose determines geometric truth**
(issue #84). Three layers are kept separate:

1. :class:`GraspProvenance` — a small, immutable, **extensible** value object
   recording the generator's claim. It validates only *representation*
   invariants (below); it does not know which ``(primitive, mode)`` pairs exist
   or how axes/faces/angles relate. Labels are free strings, so third-party grasp
   generators can use their own vocabulary without modifying sstsr.
2. Native conformance (``tsr.hands._conformance.validate_builtin_provenance``)
   owns the sstsr-specific vocabulary and relational checks; the built-in factory
   tests run it over every emitted template.
3. The analytic oracle (#67) derives contacts/reach/clearance from the concrete
   pose and primitive geometry, and must *not* trust provenance values as evidence
   the pose is correct.

Field frames and meanings (see docs/ARCHITECTURE.md): ``depth`` is the insertion
depth from the approached surface [m]; ``approach`` is the object-relative side
the hand occupies; ``finger_orientation`` is the object-relative direction the
pads are separated along (fingers always close along ``±y_EE``, a library
invariant); ``depth_count`` is the number of **distinct** depth levels emitted for
a *depth family* (at most the requested ``k``; fewer when the feasible band
collapses), and ``depth_index`` in ``0..depth_count-1`` orders them shallow to deep.
A depth family is the set of templates **within one factory result** whose non-depth
provenance fields are identical: ``primitive``, ``mode``, ``approach``,
``finger_orientation``, ``symmetry``, and ``metadata`` are held fixed while only
``depth``, ``depth_index``, and ``depth_count`` vary, so a family holds exactly one
template per depth level. The counters are not a global identifier across
independently generated or concatenated collections;
``symmetry`` distinguishes otherwise-equivalent templates; ``metadata`` is
descriptive only and must never be used as geometric evidence.

    exactly. It intentionally does **not** validate that a ``(primitive, mode)``
