        Every orientation is equally stable so roll and pitch are also free. The centre
        stays at ``z = radius`` for every admitted orientation, which the construction
        in :meth:`_template` guarantees structurally rather than only at zero tilt
        (#149).

        The reported ``stability_margin`` is ``0``: a sphere touches at one point
        directly beneath its centre, so it is in *neutral* equilibrium — it never tips,
        it rolls. That is a different thing from the knife-edge equilibrium a mesh face
        with a zero margin describes, and it is why the sphere survives the default
        ``min_margin_deg`` of 0 while any positive threshold rejects it.

        Args:
            radius: Sphere radius (m).
            subject: Name of the object frame.
            min_margin_deg: Discard the template if this exceeds 0, since a sphere's
                            tipping angle is 0.

        Returns:
            One template, or ``[]`` if the sphere cannot fit on the surface or a positive
            margin was required.
