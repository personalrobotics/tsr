"""Native provenance conformance for the built-in placement generators.

:class:`~tsr.placement_provenance.PlacementProvenance` is a generic, extensible value
object: it validates representation invariants only, so a third-party placement
generator can use its own vocabulary. This module owns the *sstsr-specific* vocabulary
and the relational checks a generic value object should not — which primitives the
built-ins emit, that only a sphere may omit a face normal, that ``equilibrium`` agrees
with ``support_margin``, and that the template's ``stability_margin`` really is the angle
its two recorded components imply (issue #160).

It never inspects the pose. Geometric truth is the oracle's job
(``tests/tsr/placement/_placement_oracle.py``); this only checks that a built-in
*described* its output with a self-consistent, in-vocabulary claim.

One rule is deliberately **absent**: ``footprint_radius >= support_margin``. It holds for
all four primitives, but for an arbitrary mesh with an arbitrary frame origin it is not
provable — the footprint is measured from the frame origin while the support margin is
measured from the centre of mass's projection — and a conformance rule that is only
probably true becomes a spurious failure on a user's asset.
