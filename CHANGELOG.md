# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **`TSRChain` in the C++ core: the forward half and every exact solve path** (#165, stage 2a).
  `sstsr/tsr_chain.hpp` adds `TSRChain`, `ChainSample`, `ChainSolveResult` and `SolveOptions`
  beside the pose region from stage 1, so a planner can compose regions, sample a chain, and
  check membership natively. Sampling returns the coordinates that built the pose, and those are
  a *constructive witness*: `validate_witness` certifies membership with one bounds check and one
  composition, no optimiser. A `solve` handed a validating witness takes the exact warm path —
  `nfev == 0`, `starts == 0` — which is the case a planner actually hits, since a chain used as a
  path constraint along an edge has the neighbouring state's coordinates to hand. The empty,
  single-link, all-fixed and `max_starts == 0` paths are exact too. `geodesic_distance` joins
  `sstsr/transform.hpp`.
- **The conformance corpus covers chains** (#165). `tests/reference/tsr_conformance.json` gains 8
  chains with 72 coordinate probes, 48 witness probes and 18 exact solves, and
  `tools/tsr_conformance.py --check` now walks them — it previously walked only the regions, so a
  chain regression would have passed silently. Residual comparisons use a `1e-7` floor rather
  than `1e-9`, because the geodesic's rotation term is `acos` of a value near 1 and a 1-ulp trace
  error there is reported as `2.1e-08` of angle; the old floor would have failed on a different
  libm while nothing was wrong.
- **The corpus also records `to_xyzrpy` for every region probe.** `to_xyzrpy` picks between the
  two RPY representatives of the same rotation, and that choice is invisible in `contains`,
  `distance` and `closest_transform` — which is exactly how #171 stayed hidden behind 162
  agreeing probes. Recording it, with whether the result satisfies the region's own `is_valid`,
  closes that blind spot for both implementations.

- **The C++ chain's cold inverse** (#165, stage 2b), so a planner no longer needs a witness to
  hand. It is **projected Levenberg–Marquardt with an analytic Jacobian**, and the least-squares
  form is exact rather than an approximation of the Python's objective: since
  `3 − tr(AᵀB) = ‖A − B‖²_F / 2` on SO(3), the Python's scalar `Δt·Δt + (3 − tr(RᵀR′))` *is*
  `‖r‖²` for the 12-vector `r = [Δt, (R − R′)/√2]`. One O(n) prefix/suffix sweep builds all `6n`
  Jacobian columns, so a gradient costs no extra composition — where the Python pays `6n` of them
  to finite-difference one.

  Two details are load-bearing, each shown by ablation rather than asserted: the Jacobian must be
  analytic, and the step needs gradient projection (a coordinate pinned at a bound whose gradient
  pushes further out is held fixed). Removing the projection takes the SO(3)-ball fixture from
  40/40 to 17/40 and quadruples the evaluations elsewhere. The solver finds the deterministic
  counterexample of issue #85 — a provable member the Python's cold solve reports as
  `not_found` — on its first start, at a residual of `1.4e-17`.

  The cold path stays specified by **properties**, not by recorded numbers, and that does not
  change just because this solver is better: `not_found` is not a proof of non-membership in
  either implementation.

### Added
- **Every placement template carries a structured `PlacementProvenance`** (#160). Grasp
  templates have declared their semantics structurally since 2.2.0, and clause 8 of the
  geometric contract forbids inferring semantics by parsing `name` — but placement left
  a caller no alternative, since the resting face's normal, the lever arm behind the
  reported tipping angle, and the footprint radius that set the `Bw` inset lived only
  inside a free-text name or nowhere at all. The record carries the primitive, the
  object-frame face normal, `support_margin` and `com_height` (so
  `stability_margin == atan2(support_margin, com_height)` is auditable rather than merely
  asserted), `footprint_radius`, `equilibrium`, and for a mesh its face and merged-facet
  counters. Same three layers as the grasp side: a representation-only value object that
  stays open to third-party vocabularies, `tsr.placement._conformance` for the sstsr
  vocabulary and the relational rules, and an oracle that never trusts either.
- **`equilibrium` separates neutral from knife-edge.** A sphere contacts at a point and
  *rolls*; a mesh face with a vanishing margin is about to tip. Both read as
  `stability_margin ≈ 0`, and nothing distinguished them before.
- **`tsr.ProvenanceKindError`.** A serialized `provenance` block now carries a `kind`;
  absent means `"grasp"`, so every record sstsr has written still reads. An unrecognised
  kind raises this rather than a `ValueError`, because `load_templates_from_directory`
  skips those with a warning — right for a truncated file, wrong for a record from a
  newer version, which would otherwise make a directory load silently come back empty.

### Added
- **A C++ core with a CMake package** (#165). `cpp/` is a second implementation of the
  pose region, for a planner that needs TSRs in C++ without a Python call per edge
  sample. It moved here from `sscbirrt`, which had been carrying it: a second
  implementation of sstsr's contract was living outside sstsr, so every rule change here
  had to be followed there — 3.1 → 3.2's construction validation was one.

  Standard library only, C++20; a transform is `std::array<double, 16>` and the generator
  is `std::mt19937_64`, so a consumer inherits no linear-algebra dependency and the
  exported config needs no `find_dependency`. The wheel stays `py3-none-any` and carries
  the sources and headers rather than a binary, so the release pipeline and install story
  are unchanged. `tsr.get_cmake_dir()` and `tsr.get_include()` are how a C++ consumer
  finds it; `docs/CPP.md` has the `find_package` recipe, and `cpp/examples/` has working
  consumers for both the installed package and the one inside a wheel.

  The Python stays the source of truth for the rules. The C++ is held to them by a
  checked-in corpus of the Python's answers — 162 probes across 9 regions, `contains`
  exactly, lengths to 1e-9 — and the constants it restates are checked against the
  Python's, since a drifting tolerance fails much later than it is introduced.

  Chains arrived in the two entries above. `docs/CPP.md` records what a port can and cannot
  promise, which is what split them: the forward and witness paths are exactly specifiable, the
  cold inverse is not, because "best found" is taken over an optimiser's trajectory including its
  finite-difference probes.
- **`TSR.volume`** and **`TSR.continuous_bounds`**, which make the measure and the
  continuous chart part of the region's public surface rather than a private attribute the
  conformance generator reached into. `tsr.sampling._interval_sum` now delegates to
  `TSR.volume`, so the measure has one definition for both implementations.

### Fixed
- **`TSR.to_xyzrpy` no longer returns coordinates its own `TSR` rejects** (#171). It passed the
  full six-row `_Bw_cont` to `rot_within_rpy_bounds`, but that helper reads rows 0–2 of
  whatever bounds it is handed — so the roll/pitch/yaw candidates were being checked against
  the **x/y/z translation** bounds. The check then almost always failed and the method fell
  back to the raw `rot_to_rpy` extraction. RPY double-covers rotations, and `rot_to_rpy`
  always reports `|pitch| <= π/2`, so for any region whose pitch bounds lie outside that range
  the returned triple was the *other* representative of the same rotation — out of bounds.
  `to_xyzrpy` therefore contradicted `contains` and `is_valid` for **25.9%** of contained poses
  (measured over 4000 random regions). It propagated to `TSRChain.solve`'s single-link path and
  from there to `TSRChain.distance`, `to_xyzrpy` and `closest_transform`. The two other call
  sites, `is_valid` and `contains`, always sliced correctly; now all three do.

  It hid because the conformance corpus records `contains`, `distance` and `closest_transform`
  but never `to_xyzrpy` directly, so #170's 162 probes could not see it. It surfaced while
  building the chain corpus for #165, when the C++ port — which reads the rotation rows, as
  `contains` does — disagreed on a single-link exact solve.
- **A `TSRChain` no longer accepts a frame it will not read** (#166). A chain places
  every link after the first on the previous link's end frame, so a later link's own
  `T0_w` never participates — but one could be passed, and was silently dropped. The
  offset then disappeared while the chain still produced a plausible pose, wrong by
  exactly that amount: the reported case was a door-handle grasp whose template
  `T_ref_tsr` became the second link's `T0_w`, landing the grasp 8 cm low with nothing
  logged and planning failing somewhere unrelated. `append` — which every constructor
  and `from_dict` funnels through — now raises `ValueError` naming the offset it will not
  use and where it belongs: post-multiplied into the **previous** link's `Tw_e`, which is
  what moves the end frame the next link hangs off. The first link is unaffected; it is
  placed by its own `T0_w`.

### Changed
- `tsr.placement._stable_poses.stable_poses_mesh` yields a `StableFace` record instead
  of a 3-tuple (internal; it is not exported).

## [3.2.0] — 2026-09

A TSR now rejects a malformed region at construction instead of letting it surface
later as a NaN distance or a projection that never converges.

The reason it matters beyond this package: pycbirrt is building a native C++ TSR
runtime checked *differentially* against this implementation, so sstsr is now a
reference implementation and its construction rules are a shared contract rather than
an internal detail. That is why the tolerance is exported and why the rules are stated
in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` as conditions on the inputs — which argument, which
condition, which tolerance — so a second implementation can reproduce them without
reading the Python. Pin `sstsr>=3.2` to rely on them.

### Added
- **`TSR.__init__` rejects a malformed region** (#162). A frame must be a finite 4×4
  whose last row is `[0, 0, 0, 1]` and whose rotation block satisfies `R Rᵀ = I` and
  `det R = +1`; `Bw` must be a finite 6×2; translation rows must be ordered. Previously
  only the last of these was checked, so a non-finite frame, a scaled or reflected
  rotation block, or a NaN in `Bw` was accepted and surfaced much later as a NaN
  distance, an unusable sample, or a projection that never converged. A **rotational**
  row with `hi < lo` remains valid — it is an outer interval wrapping through ±π.
- **`tsr.FRAME_ATOL`**, the absolute tolerance those frame checks use (`1e-6`). It is
  public because the contract is shared: pycbirrt's native TSR runtime is checked
  differentially against this implementation and applies the same rules at the same
  tolerance (personalrobotics/pycbirrt#87).

- **A checked-in placement mutation gate** (#159). 3.1.0's claim that corrupting the
  placement generator fails the suite was a measurement taken once, from a throwaway
  plugin; nothing in the repository held it. Eleven mutants now run against a
  deterministic corpus through the same check functions the property matrix uses, and
  the weekly release gate covers the placement suites at `TSR_MATRIX_SCALE=10`
  alongside the grasp ones. Writing it down caught an error in the original
  verification: `TSRTemplate` is frozen, so the variant-relabelling mutant had been
  *raising* rather than being detected.

Additive validation on inputs that were already unusable, so no working caller changes.

## [3.1.0] — 2026-09

Placement templates now mean what they say. 2.2.0 did this for grasps (#65); this does
it for placement (#148), and it found the same class of defect — a region admitting
poses that violate the property it claims — in every factory.

The visible consequences: a sphere no longer sinks through the table, no admitted pose
hangs off the surface, `stability_margin` is the physical tipping angle rather than a
number that changed when you rotated the object, every factory reports that margin and
takes `min_margin_deg`, and a mesh loaded from a file keeps its stable poses instead of
losing them to float32 rounding.

Two behaviour changes worth reading before upgrading: `Bw`'s xy extents are now
narrower than `table_x`/`table_y` by the object's footprint, and factories return `[]`
where they previously returned unusable templates. Both are listed under Fixed.

### Fixed
- **Freeing roll or pitch no longer sinks the object** (#149). `StablePlacer` carried
  the resting height in `Tw_e`'s translation, which a pose's own roll and pitch rotate:
  `place_sphere` — the one factory that frees them, and advertises it — put the sphere's
  centre at `r·cos(roll)·cos(pitch)`, so every admitted pose but a measure-zero set
  penetrated the surface, at `roll = π` entirely below it. The height now lives in
  `T_ref_tsr`, ahead of the region's rotation, and `Tw_e` is a pure rotation, so the
  resting height is invariant under every rotation `Bw` admits. Poses are unchanged for
  the templates that fix roll and pitch.
- **Placement regions no longer admit poses hanging off the surface** (#150). The `xy`
  bounds slid the object's *origin* over the full surface extent, so at the region's
  edge half a box hung off, and 61% of uniformly sampled placements overhung. Bounds
  are now inset by the object's footprint radius — the circumscribed radius, because
  yaw is free, so a per-axis inset would still overhang by the half-diagonal. An object
  too large for the surface now returns `[]` and logs `exceeds_surface`, per the
  factory contract, instead of a region no pose of which is valid.
- **`stability_margin` is the tipping angle it is documented to be** (#151). The
  COM-to-edge distance was measured in a projection that dropped the dominant axis of
  the face normal, foreshortening it by up to `1/√3`: margins were under-reported by up
  to 40%, and the *same rigid object* re-expressed in a rotated frame reported different
  angles — a physical quantity that depended on an arbitrary frame choice. Measured in
  an orthonormal basis of the face's own plane, it now reproduces the analytic angle
  exactly: a regular octahedron reports 35.264° rather than 22.21°, and a box reports
  the same three angles in every one of 3000 random object frames. This also corrects
  the "most stable first" ordering and the `min_margin_deg` threshold, both of which
  were computed from the wrong number.
- **Stability containment is scale-invariant and fails closed** (#153). The test
  compared a cross product — an *area* — against an absolute `1e-10`, so below ~1e-5 m
  every edge test was skipped and the helper fell through to "inside": an obtuse
  tetrahedron whose centroid provably projects outside its bottom facet was reported as
  resting on it, with a fabricated 86° margin that ranked it the most stable face.
  Containment is now decided on an in-plane *length* against the scale-aware `atol`, and
  an indeterminate test rejects the pose. A centre of mass exactly on a support edge is
  a critical equilibrium and is no longer returned as a rest.
- **A mesh with float32 vertices no longer loses its stable poses** (#152). Co-planar
  hull facets were grouped by an 8-decimal rounding of the face normal, which splits a
  face whenever its facets straddle a rounding boundary. A rotated 0.20 × 0.10 × 0.30 box
  whose vertices came from float32 fragmented into twelve single-triangle "faces", none
  able to support the centre of mass: 3.0.0 answered with twelve templates all claiming
  a 0° margin — each admitted by the default filter — and with containment now failing
  closed it would answer with none at all. This is the ordinary path for a mesh loaded
  from a file, since STL, OBJ, glTF and MuJoCo all store float32. Facets are now grouped
  by plane *proximity*, and the float32 box reports the same six angles as its float64
  twin. The tolerance is deliberately tight: a tessellated curved surface keeps its
  facets, because `place_mesh` describes the polyhedron it was given and cannot know a
  48-gon prism was meant to be a cylinder.
- **Non-finite placement input is rejected at ingress** (#154). `nan` and `inf`
  dimensions passed `x <= 0` and produced entirely finite templates, leaving no trace
  of the invalid request; `place_mesh` reported a non-finite vertex as a degenerate
  hull, and `min_margin_deg=nan` as an empty feasible set. Dimensions, surface extents,
  `vertices`, `com` and `min_margin_deg` now raise `ValueError` naming the argument.

### Added
- **An independent placement oracle and soundness matrix** (#148). The placement
  counterpart of the #67/#73 grasp work: `tests/tsr/placement/_placement_oracle.py`
  certifies a concrete posed object from support functions of the caller's own
  geometry, never from a construction formula, and `test_placement_soundness.py` drives
  every public `place_*` factory through it at the `Bw` midpoint, every free
  dimension's extrema, all corners and interior points, under an arbitrary surface
  pose. A guard test fails if a new factory skips the matrix.
- **The geometric placement contract** in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: frames, what a pose
  places, surface-extent semantics, four soundness clauses, the construction rules that
  make them structural, and the open deviations still tracked under #148.
- **Every placement template reports a `stability_margin`, and every factory takes
  `min_margin_deg`** (#156). The primitives were opaque where `place_mesh` was
  self-describing, so a caller could not tell a 1.15° knife-edge rest from a 45° one, or
  reject it. The values are analytic — `arctan(min(a,b)/l)` for a box face,
  `arctan(r/(h/2))` for a cylinder cap, `arctan(R/r)` for a torus lying flat — and
  routing the same box through `place_box` and `place_mesh` now gives the same margins.
  A sphere reports `0`: it is neutrally stable, so it rolls rather than tipping, and any
  positive threshold rejects it.

### Changed
- **`place_mesh` and `place_cylinder` no longer appear to contradict each other** on a
  tessellated cylinder, and the relationship is now documented and tested rather than
  left to the reader. A cylinder cut into `n` sides rests on each at exactly `180/n`
  degrees — a margin that tends to 0 as the tessellation refines, which is the ideal
  cylinder's own answer, since it contacts along a line and rolls rather than tipping.
  Passing `min_margin_deg` above `180/n` returns exactly what `place_cylinder` returns.
- `place_torus`'s docstring said it returned one template while it returned two
  (#155). Both sides are returned, as for the box's faces and the cylinder's caps,
  because which side is down is caller-visible in `variant` and distinct for a labelled
  object; the documented count now matches, and the rule is stated once in the contract.
- Placement documentation called a placed pose a "COM z" throughout, a leftover from
  the C2 fix that was off by half an object for a mesh whose origin is not its centre.
  It is the object frame origin. `README.md` also claimed `place_box` returns "up to 3
  poses"; it returns six.

## [3.0.0] — 2026-09

**Breaking.** The PyVista backend is removed. `sstsr[viz]` now installs Viser, so an
existing install keeps working and gets the supported backend; code importing
`tsr.viz` must move to `tsr.viser` — see `docs/MIGRATION-VISER.md`, which maps every
removed workflow. Pin `sstsr<3` if you need browser-free PNG rendering, which has no
replacement.

Visualization is now one thing: an interactive viewer you interrogate, rather than a
picture of samples. `studio()` closes the loop for development — change a primitive,
the gripper or the clearance and watch the TSRs change, with the factory's own reason
shown when a request yields nothing.

Nothing about grasp geometry changed in this release: the 2.2.0 correctness work and
its oracle-backed matrix are untouched, and `pip install sstsr` remains
visualization-free.

### Removed
- **The PyVista backend** (#140), after shipping deprecated in 2.3: `tsr.viz`,
  `TSRVisualizer`, every `*_renderer`, and `GripperBase.renderer()` / the
  `ParallelJawGripper` override that reached into it. Visualization is `tsr.viser`.
- **PyVista, Matplotlib and Pillow as visualization dependencies.** `sstsr[viz]` and
  `sstsr[viser]` now install the same thing — Viser — so an existing `sstsr[viz]`
  install keeps working and gets the supported backend. `pip install sstsr` remains
  visualization-free, and importing sstsr still loads neither backend nor starts a
  server. Pillow moved to the dev group, where the figure script uses it.
- **Browser-free PNG rendering.** Viser renders through a connected browser; there is
  no replacement. Pin `sstsr<3` if you need it. `docs/MIGRATION-VISER.md` maps each
  removed workflow to its replacement.
- The three PyVista examples keep their printed API demonstrations and lose their
  rendering: `scripts/render_readme_figures.py` builds those same scenes in Viser, and
  `tsr.viser.studio()` is the interactive path, so re-implementing them would have
  duplicated both.

### Added
- **`tsr.viser.studio()`** — an interactive bench for debugging grasp generation.
  Choose a primitive, drag its dimensions and the gripper's, pick a factory and change
  `k`, clearance or `n_minor`; the templates regenerate and redraw on every change.
  When a request yields nothing the factory's own diagnostic is surfaced
  (`exceeds_aperture`, `finger_too_short`, `insufficient_clearance_band`), and an
  invalid request is reported as invalid rather than as an empty feasible set — the
  two failures the factory contract deliberately separates. Sliders and the factory
  list are derived from `PRIMITIVE_SPECS`, so they cannot drift from the real
  signatures. A `Show` folder isolates one depth level or one **mode**
  (`filter_templates` / `mode_of`, available without the GUI); the options are rebuilt
  from whatever the request produced. A *mode* is `mode/approach/finger_orientation`,
  deliberately coarser than the *depth family* of `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (which also
  fixes `symmetry` and `metadata`): a torus side grasp is one mode covering ten depth
  families. The viewer wants the coarse grouping, so it does not reuse the word
  *family* for it.
- The viewer draws jaws at the **template's own preshape** (`span + clearance`), so the
  opening differs per template — a torus side grasp closes on the tube, a torus span
  grasp swallows the ring. A template carrying no preshape is drawn as axes only rather
  than substituting the gripper's `max_aperture`, which would show a far coarser grasp
  than the template claims.

### Fixed
- **The release build pins the version with the generic setuptools-scm variable.**
  `SETUPTOOLS_SCM_PRETEND_VERSION_FOR_SSTSR` is silently ignored — hatch-vcs does not
  pass the distribution name through — so a tag build still fell back to `git describe`
  and, with an rc and its final tag on one commit, resolved to the rc. The `v2.3.0`
  build produced `2.3.0rc1` and the tag/artifact guard stopped it before publishing.
  Verified by building with each variable set to `9.9.9`: the per-distribution form
  produced `2.3.0` (from describe), the generic form produced `9.9.9`.

## [2.3.0] — 2026-09

Interactive visualization. `tsr.viser` replaces static rendering as the recommended way
to inspect grasp templates: it serves a scene you interrogate rather than a picture of
samples, with a slider per free `Bw` coordinate so a continuous freedom is scrubbed
instead of sampled. The PyVista backend still works and is now deprecated, with a
migration guide and one published release of warning before it is removed in 3.0.

Visualization remains explanatory and diagnostic. It is never evidence that a template
is correct — that is the analytic oracle's job.

### Added
- **Interactive Viser viewer** (`tsr.viser`, `pip install "sstsr[viser]"`; #77).
  `show_templates` draws a reproducibly sampled pose cloud — reference object, canonical
  end-effector axes, and jaw geometry at each template's own preshape — and
  `explore_templates` drives a single grasp from one slider per **free** `Bw` coordinate
  (from `free_coordinates`), so a continuous freedom is scrubbed rather than sampled.
  Viser stays optional: `import tsr` pulls in neither backend and never starts a server,
  and the default test suite does not require the extra.

### Changed
- **The README figures are rendered with Viser** (`scripts/render_readme_figures.py`),
  so the documentation images no longer depend on PyVista ahead of its removal. Grasp
  panels are captured per primitive and composed; the placement figures are single
  shared-table scenes with each box face in a fixed colour, which is what shows that
  the placer finds all six faces, both cylinder caps and both torus sides.
  `tsr.viser.add_primitive` and `torus_mesh` were added to support this — Viser has no
  native torus.

### Deprecated
- **The PyVista backend (`tsr.viz`) is deprecated and will be removed in sstsr 3.0**
  (#139). Viser is now the recommended viewer in the README, examples and docs.
  Constructing `TSRVisualizer` emits a `DeprecationWarning` naming the replacement, the
  removal version and the migration guide; **importing `tsr.viz` does not warn**, so a
  library that imports it cannot warn on its users' behalf. Nothing breaks in 2.x: the
  backend keeps working and the `viz` extra still installs PyVista — repointing it at
  Viser in a minor release would silently change what an install provides.
  `docs/MIGRATION-VISER.md` states the replacement for every public PyVista workflow.
- **Browser-free PNG rendering ends with PyVista.** Viser's pixels come from a browser's
  WebGL context: `get_render` is a method on a *connected* `ClientHandle`, viser 1.1.1
  exposes no offscreen or screenshot API, and the scene serializer produces a `.viser`
  file or a standalone interactive HTML page rather than an image. This is an accepted
  consequence of the migration, documented rather than discovered: through 2.x use
  `tsr.viz`; from 3.0 images are captured from the viewer.
- **The release version comes from the git tag** (hatch-vcs). `pyproject.toml` no
  longer carries a static `version`; `tsr.__version__` reads the build-time
  `_version.py`, falling back to installed metadata. This makes the TestPyPI dry run
  real: an rc tag now necessarily builds an rc artifact, whereas through 2.2.0 the
  static version meant `v2.2.0rc1` published `2.2.0` to TestPyPI and the rc was never
  exercised. The release workflow additionally refuses to publish when the built
  artifact's version does not equal the tag, or when an rc tag builds a final version
  (or vice versa). In CI the version is pinned from the ref rather than inferred:
  `git describe` must choose when several tags point at one commit — the normal
  rc → final flow — and it resolved to the rc in CI while resolving to the final tag
  locally. The guard caught exactly that before anything was published. See
  `docs/RELEASING.md`.

## [2.2.0] — 2026-09

Establishes the *geometric* correctness of primitive parallel-jaw grasp templates
(epic #65). 2.1.0 guaranteed that a template was well **formed**; 2.2.0 guarantees
that every pose it admits is a viable parallel-jaw pre-grasp, certified against an
independent analytic oracle rather than against the generator's own formulas.

**Highlights**

- An executable **geometric contract** (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`) and an independent
  **analytic oracle** for boxes, cylinders, spheres and tori (#66, #67).
- **Seven generator defects fixed**, each with a deterministic regression: palm
  inside the object beyond finger reach (#69), whole-face rejection from one thin
  box dimension (#70), torus minor-angle and coverage semantics (#71), cylinder caps
  ignoring the height (#122), contacts on edges at near-zero clearance (#121),
  straddle feasibility decided on sums without slack (#129), and a default preshape
  that could refuse the clearance it was asked for (#131).
- A **Hypothesis property matrix** over every factory, combined entry point and
  named gripper, plus a **mutation gate** that fails if the generator is corrupted
  (#73) — it found #121, #122 and #129.
- **Structured provenance** on every template (#66, #81), and set coverage separated
  from sampling distribution, with a Haar-uniform sampler (#72).

Templates that were previously emitted but are not geometrically sound are now
withheld: short-cylinder cap grasps beyond the far cap, near-zero-clearance box and
cylinder poses on edges, and grasps whose jaw margin sits below the straddle floor.

### Changed
- **Packaged YAML templates have an explicit assurance boundary** (#75). The seven
  hand-authored examples are now smoke-tested through the public loading and
  instantiation APIs and documented as representation-valid recipes, not as
  analytically certified primitive grasps. This avoids a parallel validation manifest
  for templates that intentionally omit primitive dimensions and gripper geometry.

### Fixed
- **Straddle feasibility is decided on the margin, with slack** (#129). `_infeasibility_reason`
  compared *sums* — `preshape` against `object_span + 2·atol` — so when the margin was
  orders of magnitude smaller than the span the addition lost it and a margin below the
  floor was accepted (e.g. `Robotiq2F85().grasp_sphere(0.02125, clearance=c)` with `c`
  one ulp under the floor). It now tests `preshape − object_span`, which is exact by
  Sterbenz, and requires `4·atol(scale)` — each pad clearing the object by `2·atol`,
  twice the oracle's tolerance, for the same reason #121 doubles the edge margin: at
  exactly `2·atol` the oracle's clause-2 bound lands on the contact coordinate and ~59%
  of sampled poses were uncertifiable, while any larger margin left none. A **default**
  preshape is now built by `GripperBase._default_preshape`, which advances `span + c`
  until the realized margin is at least the requested clearance, so asking for the
  documented floor is honoured instead of being rejected by the rounding of that sum
  (#131); an explicitly supplied preshape is never altered. Ordinary clearances and
  preshapes are unaffected. Found by the #73 property matrix.
- **Box and cylinder contacts stay off the edges at zero or sub-tolerance clearance**
  (#121). `clearance = 0` is a valid request (#104), but the closed bands used the
  edges themselves as limits, so contacts landed exactly on an edge: zero insertion
  (`grasp_box_top(0.05, 0.05, 0.05, clearance=0)` emitted a depth-0 template whose
  fingertips only touch the face), a contact on the far face, a lateral slide edge, or
  a cylinder rim, where the surface normal is ambiguous. Every edge-facing band limit
  now uses `m = max(clearance, 2 · _length_atol(scale))`, mirroring the scale-aware
  straddle margin (#107): the box approach and slide bands, the cylinder cap bands,
  and the cylinder-side height band. Clearances above the tolerance are unchanged, and
  palm clearance and the default preshape still use the requested clearance. Found by
  the #73 property matrix.
- **Cylinder cap insertion depth is bounded by the height** (#122). `grasp_cylinder_top`
  and `grasp_cylinder_bottom` built depths over `[clearance, finger_length − clearance]`
  and ignored the cylinder, so on a short cylinder the deeper templates pushed the
  fingertips past the opposite cap (#67 oracle clause 4) — including at the default
  clearance, e.g. `grasp_cylinder_top(0.02, 0.03, clearance=0.006)` with 80 mm fingers
  emitted depths 0.04 and 0.074 into a 30 mm cylinder. The band is now
  `d ∈ [m, min(finger_length, cylinder_height) − m]` with the edge margin
  `m = max(clearance, 2 · atol(scale))` (#121), the same rule the box approach bands
  use, returning `[]` with `insufficient_clearance_band` when empty.
  Found by the #73 property matrix.
- **Grasp provenance depth-count semantics** (#81). `GraspProvenance.depth_count` is
  now documented and guaranteed to be the number of **distinct** depth levels emitted
  for a family (`≤ k`), with `depth_index` ordering them shallow to deep. The shared
  depth helper already collapsed an exact one-point band to a single depth (#68);
  it now also drops duplicates when a band only a few ulps wide makes `np.linspace`
  round samples onto the same float, which previously produced repeated depths that
  all reported `depth_count = k`. A Hypothesis property checks the invariant for every
  grasp factory, including the combined entry points, with one-point-band tests
  per family and ulp-wide-band regressions.
- **Sphere grasp coverage vs. sampling distribution** (#72). `grasp_sphere` claimed
  its roll/pitch/yaw box makes sampling produce "uniformly distributed approach
  directions"; independent uniform RPY (`TSR.sample`) is **not** Haar-uniform on
  SO(3) and concentrates approach directions near the poles. The docs now separate
  the represented set (all of SO(3) by default) from the sampling distribution, and
  define a restricted `angle_range` precisely: approach directions in the **lune**
  `azimuth ∈ angle_range` (not a spherical cap), any spin about the approach axis.
  Template descriptions no longer say "full SO(3)" when yaw is restricted.
- **Torus minor-angle, reach, clearance, and coverage semantics** (#71). Torus-side
  grasps applied no clearance to the deep depth endpoint (`min(2r, L)`), so the palm
  could sit inside the tube surface (oracle clause 3); the band now follows the same
  reach/clearance rule as cylinder-side and sphere,
  `d ∈ [tube_radius, min(2·tube_radius, finger_length) − clearance]`, returning `[]`
  with `finger_too_short` when `finger_length < tube_radius + clearance`, or with
  `insufficient_clearance_band` when reach is ample but `clearance > tube_radius`
  empties the far-surface limit (#114). Torus-span
  grasps used a `[clearance, L − clearance]` depth band whose shallow depths did not
  reach the equatorial plane (the widest outer diameter), so the fingertip stopped
  short (oracle clause 5); the band now starts at `tube_radius` (the fingertip
  reaches the equator) up to `finger_length − clearance`. `n_minor == 1` now samples
  the **centre** of the minor-angle range (the equator `α = 0` by default) instead of
  `linspace(...)[0] = −π/2` (a lower approach). A new `minor_angle_range` parameter
  (keyword-only, default `[−π/2, +π/2]`) makes the represented set explicit and is
  accepted by `GripperBase.grasp_torus_side`, the combined `grasp_torus`, and the
  registry route, which forwards it to side grasps only; existing positional calls
  are unchanged (#112). It must lie within the externally accessible **outer half**,
  validated as an exact closed interval with no tolerance: endpoints exactly on
  `±π/2` are valid, anything outside raises `ValueError`; inner-hole approaches are
  out of scope (#113). Torus-side straddle feasibility uses the
  scale-aware tolerance with the torus scale `R + r` (#107). A new oracle-backed
  property (`tests/tsr/hands/test_torus_soundness.py`) certifies every side and span
  pose against the #67 analytic oracle, with rotational equivariance about the axis,
  equatorial mirror balance, reach boundaries, and the minor-angle/coverage semantics,
  including generated custom minor-angle subintervals through the direct and combined APIs.
- **Per-orientation box grasp feasibility** (#70). Each box face offers two
  finger-opening orientations (open along one in-face axis, slide along the other).
  The factories used to reject the **whole face** when either slide band was empty,
  so a thin dimension discarded a still-valid perpendicular orientation
  (`grasp_box_top(0.003, 0.06, 0.05)` returned `[]` although span-x straddles the
  thin x and slides along y). Feasibility is now evaluated **per orientation** — a
  negative slide band or an over-wide span removes only that orientation, and the
  public method emits one diagnostic only when the whole requested family is empty.
  A slide dimension exactly `2·clearance` yields a *zero-width* band, kept as one
  fixed centered pose (only a negative band is empty), per the exact-interval
  convention (#105, #110).
  The insertion-depth band is now capped by the box's extent **along the approach
  axis** (`min(finger_length, extent) − clearance`), so the fingertip clears the far
  face by a clearance rather than penetrating a short box, and box straddle
  feasibility uses the contract's scale-aware tolerance (#107). A new oracle-backed
  property (`tests/tsr/hands/test_box_soundness.py`) certifies every emitted pose
  across all six faces and both orientations against the #67 analytic oracle, with
  axis-swap invariance, opposite-face mirror consistency, thin-dimension removal,
  and aperture/slide boundary regressions — all reading structural provenance, never
  parsing display names.
- **Cylinder-side and sphere reach soundness** (#69, #107, #108). The radial depth
  band `[radius, min(finger_length, 2·radius) − clearance]` can be empty for two
  distinct reasons — the fingers are too short to keep the palm outside with
  clearance (`finger_length < radius + clearance`), or reach is ample but an
  excessive clearance relative to the radius empties the far-surface limit — and the
  factories now classify the empty set accordingly (`finger_too_short`, precedence,
  else `insufficient_clearance_band`), so the short-finger case that used to emit a
  palm-inside template is `[]` with an accurate reason (#108). Factory straddle
  feasibility now uses the contract's **scale-aware tolerance** (`_length_atol`,
  `1e-9 + 1e-6·scale`, matching the oracle): a preshape whose contact-to-jaw margin
  is below tolerance yields `[]` with `cannot_straddle` rather than a template the
  oracle rejects (#107). A new oracle-backed property
  (`tests/tsr/hands/test_reach_soundness.py`) certifies every emitted cylinder-side
  and sphere pose — at its `Bw` extrema and midpoint — against the independent #67
  analytic oracle, across radius/finger-length/aperture/clearance/`k`, the exact
  reach and aperture boundaries and their `nextafter` neighbours at several scales,
  SO(3) equivariance for spheres, and the named grippers at their reach boundaries.
  No previously-sound templates were removed.
- **Gripper parameter hardening and empty-depth semantics** (#68). An excessive
  positive `clearance` (more than half the finger length) used to make the
  cylinder-cap, box, and torus-span factories build depths with
  `linspace(clearance, finger_length - clearance, k)` over a *reversed* interval,
  silently emitting templates with a backwards shallow-to-deep ordering. A shared
  `_usable_depths` helper now returns `[]` with reason `insufficient_clearance_band`
  when the band is empty, under an **exact, scale-independent** boundary policy
  (`hi < lo` → empty; `hi == lo` → one deduplicated slot; `hi > lo` → `k` depths) —
  a positive-width interval never collapses through a default `np.isclose` tolerance,
  and a single-slot template gets a single-slot human label (#105). Input validation
  is centralized and applied uniformly across every factory: finite/positive
  `finger_length`, `max_aperture`, primitive dimensions and `preshape`; finite,
  nonnegative `clearance_fraction` **and every explicit per-call `clearance`**
  (NaN/inf/negative/Boolean raise a `ValueError` naming `clearance`, before it
  derives any preshape/bounds/depths; `clearance=0` stays valid) (#104); integer
  `k >= 1` and `n_minor >= 1`; finite, ordered `angle_range`; and positive
  `cylinder_height` for the side/top/bottom entry points alike. Nonsensical arguments
  raise `ValueError`; valid arguments with an empty feasible set return `[]` with one
  coherent diagnostic log. No generated template contains NaN or infinity.
  Property-tested with non-finite/zero/negative scalars, `nextafter` boundary
  neighbours at small/ordinary/large scale, excessive clearances, and
  integral/non-integral counts.

### Added
- **Hypothesis property matrix and mutation-sensitive release gate** (#73).
  `tests/tsr/hands/_grasp_matrix.py` drives every public `grasp_*` factory — combined
  entry points and named grippers included — through the independent #67 oracle, with
  cases across scale and aspect regimes and `boundary_cases` that sit exactly on, and
  one ulp either side of, every documented feasibility boundary. Seven invariants are
  checked: oracle witness at Bw extrema/corners/interior points, argument validation
  vs. physical infeasibility, rigid-transform equivariance, primitive and
  opposite-face symmetries, feasibility monotonicity, declared coverage and structured
  uniqueness (including combined == parts, compared as whole templates so semantic and
  display fields count), and witness preservation through dict/JSON/YAML round-trips.
  Documented feasibility boundaries are additionally pinned per factory family and
  asserted as below/exact/above *transitions*, since an empty result satisfies the
  other checks vacuously. `tests/tsr/hands/test_grasp_mutation_gate.py` injects
  each bug class from #73 — approach sign, face origin, axis mapping, object extent,
  clearance term, reach, plus code mutants patching `_resolve_clearance`,
  `_usable_depths` and `_infeasibility_reason` — and requires the same checks to
  reject it, with two documented, re-certified exclusions where the "mutation" is a
  true symmetry. Budgets scale with `TSR_MATRIX_SCALE` (default 1, ~11 s); the new
  weekly/on-demand `release-gate` workflow runs at 10x in its own concurrency group. The matrix found #121 and #122
  on its first run. See docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, "Verification matrix and release gate".
- **`sample_haar` / `sample_haar_xyzrpy`** (`tsr.sampling`, exported from `tsr`;
  #72). Samples a TSR with rotations Haar-uniform over its Bw box by drawing roll and
  yaw uniformly and `sin(pitch)` uniformly (the ZYX Haar density is `∝ cos(pitch)`);
  translation is uniform. Requires pitch bounds within `[-π/2, π/2]` (exact, else
  `ValueError`); a nonzero pitch interval may touch `±π/2`, but a pitch fixed exactly
  at the ZYX gimbal lock is rejected, since roll and yaw are coupled there (#116).
  Reproducible under an explicit `rng`, and kept separate from
  `TSR.sample`, which is unchanged. For sphere grasps it gives approach directions
  uniform by area over the sphere or lune. Deterministic KS tests
  (`tests/tsr/test_haar_sampling.py`, `tests/tsr/hands/test_sphere_sampling.py`)
  check the rotation-angle law, uniform axes, lune semantics, and left-invariance
  under reference rotations; a Hypothesis property checks set membership, and every
  sphere-grasp Haar sample keeps a #67 oracle witness.
- **Independent analytic grasp oracle** (#67, #93–#102, test-side) in
  `tests/tsr/hands/_grasp_oracle.py`: certifies the geometric-soundness clauses of
  the #66 contract for box / cylinder / sphere / torus. Contact geometry is
  **exact per `(primitive, mode)`** — closed-form line/surface intersection derives
  jaw contacts, span, analytic normals, realized insertion depth, torus minor
  angle, and clearance-aware usable bands from the concrete pose (no sampling grid,
  so results are resolution-independent and scale-equivariant; ~0.1 ms/cert). An
  independent signed-distance representation is used only to *verify* those
  analytic contacts, never to search (#93). `mode` (and optional `approach` /
  `finger_orientation`) select and are *checked against* the pose — a mislabeled
  mode fails — and mode-specific clearance bands (cylinder ends, box edges) are
  enforced (#94). All inputs are validated up front: a malformed model raises
  `ValueError`, a malformed pose returns a structured clause-1 failure, and a
  reflection (`det(R) = -1`) or non-finite clearance is rejected (#95). Clearance
  bands are enforced along the full insertion interval for cap/face grasps, not
  just laterally (#96); aperture fit is **pose-relative** (both contacts must lie
  between the open jaws about the palm, so an object translated outside the finite
  opening no longer certifies on span alone, #97); declared `approach` labels use
  the hand-occupied-side convention with a built-in vocabulary that raises on
  unknown labels and fails clause 8 on a geometric mismatch (#98); and the
  torus-side model handles the full approach-minor-angle range with tube-centre
  ray verification, reporting the pose-derived approach minor angle (#99).
  Axis-aligned modes use a true angular tolerance and every accepted contact must
  lie in the concrete posed finger sweep `p + t·z_EE + s·y_EE` (#100); every
  successful witness has finite geometry and a contact plane strictly on the
  forward finger segment `0 < t ≤ L`, with `radial`/`tube`/occupied-side predicates
  checked against a shared pose-derived local frame (#101); and a deterministic
  acceptance matrix covers each mode's boundaries, axis permutations, azimuths,
  scale regimes, and real-factory provenance across all families (#102). Returns a
  structured `GraspWitness` naming the violated clause and its geometry. Its unit
  tests use hand-derived poses only. NumPy-only, no shipped-package change; it
  backs the generator repairs in #68–#73.
- **Executable geometric grasp contract** (#66) in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: four
  assurance layers (representation / soundness / coverage / embodied), eight
  soundness clauses, and the soundness-vs-coverage-vs-distribution distinctions,
  with defined tolerances and one sound + one infeasible worked example per
  primitive.
- **`GraspProvenance`** (#66, #78–#84) — a small, immutable, **extensible** value
  object on `TSRTemplate.provenance` recording each grasp's primitive, mode,
  hand-occupied `approach`, object-frame `finger_orientation`, insertion `depth`,
  `symmetry`, and descriptive `metadata`. It validates only representation
  invariants and round-trips losslessly; it is *not* a closed schema, so external
  grasp generators can use their own labels. The sstsr native vocabulary and
  cross-field relational checks live separately in
  `tsr.hands._conformance.validate_builtin_provenance`, which the built-in factory
  tests run over every emitted template. The design principle — **provenance
  declares intent; the pose determines geometric truth** — keeps these two layers
  and the analytic oracle (#67) distinct. Every `ParallelJawGripper` factory emits
  a conformant record, so tests read grasp modes structurally instead of parsing
  `name`. The sphere grasp is mode `surface` (full SO(3)), not `equatorial`.
  Representation-only; grasp geometry is unchanged.
- **Witness-aware, bounded `TSRChain` inverse membership** (#85). A chain is an
  exact parameterized set, but deciding membership from a pose alone is a bounded
  nonconvex inverse problem: a local solve can produce a positive witness, but
  failing to find one is **not** a proof of nonmembership. New API makes that
  distinction explicit:
  - `TSRChain.sample_with_witness(rng=None) -> ChainSample` returns a sampled
    `pose` and the `(n, 6)` `coordinates` that constructed it — a positive
    membership certificate needing no optimizer.
  - `TSRChain.validate_witness(pose, coordinates, tolerance=EPSILON) -> bool`
    certifies a witness with one bounds check and one forward composition — no
    SciPy, no solve.
  - `TSRChain.solve(pose, initial_guess=None, max_starts=11, max_nfev=2200) ->
    ChainSolveResult` runs a bounded, deterministic multi-start inverse solve that
    warm-starts from `initial_guess`, exits on the first tolerance-satisfying
    witness, and returns `status` (`"satisfied"`/`"not_found"`, never
    `"infeasible"`), `coordinates`, `residual`, `nfev`, and `starts`. `max_starts`
    is a **strict total** cap on optimizer starts and `max_nfev` a **strict total**
    cap on objective evaluations, enforced by an internal global counter rather
    than SciPy's soft `maxfun` (#89, #91); the valid-witness fast path takes one
    forward composition and does not import SciPy (#88); numerical controls are
    validated before SciPy is imported.
  - `ChainSample` and `ChainSolveResult` are exported from `tsr`.
- **`TSRChain.to_transform` canonicalizes wrapping rotational coordinates** before
  clamping (#87): a valid RPY coordinate expressed in `[-pi, pi]` for a wrapping
  interval (e.g. `-3.0` for `[3π/4, -3π/4]`) is wrapped into the component's
  continuous interval instead of being clipped to an unrelated boundary rotation,
  which had silently changed the pose and broken the witness contract. A single
  shared coordinate→continuous-chart helper is used by both `to_transform` and the
  inverse solver's start construction, so a wrapping neighboring-state
  `initial_guess` is canonicalized, not clipped, before it warm-starts the
  optimizer (#90). `validate_witness` on an empty chain now returns `False` instead
  of raising.

### Changed
- **`TSRChain.contains`, `distance`, and `closest_transform` are documented as
  numerical, non-certifying for multi-TSR chains** (#85). Multi-TSR `contains`
  now delegates to `solve` and accepts an optional `initial_guess` for the exact
  warm-start fast path; `False` means no witness was found within the numerical
  budget, not certified nonmembership. `distance` returns `0` with the witness
  when one is found, else a best-found residual (an upper bound on the true
  minimum). Single-TSR `contains` remains the exact closed-form check.

## [2.1.0] — 2026-09

### Added
- **`TSR.closest_transform(trans)`** (#53) and **`TSRChain.closest_transform(trans)`**
  (#63) — return the distance *and* the closest in-bounds pose in the **world
  frame** (`T0_w @ xyzrpy_to_trans(bwopt) @ Tw_e` for a TSR; the composed
  transform for a chain), so planner projection code no longer reconstructs the
  frame composition by hand (a recurring source of frame bugs).
- `Robotiq2F140.PALM_OFFSET_FROM_BASE_MOUNT = 0.100` (base_mount → grasp_site along
  approach), for symmetry with `Robotiq2F85`.

### Fixed
- **Multi-TSR `TSRChain` could still reject a pose from its own `sample()`** (#57).
  The 2.0.1 fix removed the zero-width-gradient stall, but a single midpoint-start
  L-BFGS-B could converge to an ordinary nonzero local minimum (reporting success,
  no warning) and reject a constructively-valid sample — especially with
  non-identity component frames. `TSRChain.distance` now minimises a **smooth
  squared pose residual** (the geodesic's `arccos` is non-smooth at 0 and breeds
  local minima) from **deterministic multi-start** points, and reports the true
  geodesic at the recovered coordinates. Verified across the deterministic
  non-identity-frame stress reproduction and a multi-TSR Hypothesis property.

### Changed
- **`Robotiq2F140.MAX_APERTURE` corrected `0.140 → 0.128 m`** (#60) — the usable
  inner-face-to-inner-face gap at full open, measured from `2f140.xml`. The old
  0.140 was the manufacturer's nominal/outer figure and overstated the gap by
  ~12 mm, claiming feasible grasps of objects that don't fit between the pads
  (same distinction as the `Robotiq2F85`'s 0.085 m). **Behavior change:** some
  wide grasps that previously returned templates now return `[]`.

### Documentation
- Reconciled the preconfigured grippers' `finger_length` documentation (#58). All
  three (`Robotiq2F140` 0.114 m, `Robotiq2F85` 0.059 m, `FrankaHand` 0.037 m) use
  one convention — **palm → pad tip** (finger reach along approach) — now stated
  consistently in the class docstrings, the README table, and the tests. Fixed the
  `Robotiq2F140` docstring (it claimed the wrong derivation and a stray "82 mm"),
  the stale README values (55 mm / 44.5 mm), the "pad-contact midpoint" misnomer,
  and a tutorial example that mislabeled a generic 55 mm gripper as a "2F-140".
- Finished the pad-tip terminology reconciliation (#64): the `FrankaHand.FINGER_LENGTH`
  inline comment and the historical 2.0.0 changelog line no longer say "pad-mid" /
  "pad-contact midpoint"; all named-gripper docs now say **palm → pad tip**.

## [2.0.1] — 2026-09

Patch release: correctness and reproducibility fixes from the post-merge audit
of #54. No API removals; adds an optional `rng` parameter.

### Fixed
- **Multi-TSR `TSRChain` could reject a pose from its own `sample()`** (#57).
  `TSRChain.distance` optimised over all `6·n` coordinates, so a point-bound
  coordinate (e.g. a fixed `[0, 0]`) gave a zero-width finite-difference step,
  a NaN gradient, and a stalled optimiser. It now optimises only the free
  coordinates, holding fixed ones at their value.
- **Documentation described `TSRChain` as "AND"/intersection semantics** (#55).
  A chain is the serial composition of its component TSRs, not the intersection
  of their world-frame pose sets (two serial `x∈[0,1]` TSRs reach `x=1.5`).
  Reworded the changelog, `contains()` docstring, and the semantics tests.

### Added
- **`rng` parameter** on `TSR.sample`/`sample_xyzrpy`, `TSRChain.sample`/
  `sample_xyzrpy`, and `TSRTemplate.sample`; `sample_from_tsrs` /
  `sample_from_templates` forward it (#52). Passing a `numpy.random.Generator`
  now makes the sampled *pose* reproducible, not just the TSR choice. Defaults to
  the global RNG when omitted.

### CI
- The downstream-dispatch job no longer reddens an otherwise-green run when
  `ROBOT_CODE_DISPATCH_TOKEN` is absent; it skips with a visible notice (#56).

## [2.0.0] — 2026-09

First PyPI release. The distribution is named **`sstsr`** (the name `tsr` was
already taken); the import name is unchanged — `import tsr`.

### Packaging & licensing
- **Distribution renamed to `sstsr`.** `pip install sstsr`, then `import tsr`.
- **Relicensed to BSD-2-Clause**, matching the original PrPy/OpenRAVE-derived TSR
  core (resolves the prior README-vs-LICENSE mismatch).
- Grasp/hand classes (`ParallelJawGripper`, `Robotiq2F85`, `Robotiq2F140`,
  `FrankaHand`) are now exported at the top level alongside `StablePlacer`.
- `tsr.__version__` is now available.
- Tested on Python 3.10–3.14 (classifiers and CI matrix extended to 3.13 and 3.14).

### Breaking changes
- **`TablePlacer` removed** — use `tsr.placement.StablePlacer`.
- **`TSRChain.contains()` now tests serial-composition membership** — a chain is
  the set of poses reachable by serially composing a transform from each
  component TSR (consistent with `distance()`), not a match against a single
  world-frame pose.
- **Grasp factories return `[]` for infeasible geometry instead of raising.**
  `grasp_cylinder_*` and `grasp_sphere` previously raised `ValueError` when the
  object exceeded the aperture; they now return `[]`, consistent with the box and
  torus factories. Exceptions are reserved for invalid *arguments* (non-positive
  sizes, `k < 1`, reversed `angle_range`). See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- **Gripper geometry corrections** (change sampled poses for existing callers):
  `Robotiq2F140` frame correction and `finger_length`; `FrankaHand.finger_length`
  corrected to **37 mm** (measured from the hand-body forward edge / collar to the
  pad tip, not the finger-joint origin); clearance is now scaled by
  graspable depth, not `finger_length`.

### Fixed
- **RPY near gimbal lock** (`rot_to_rpy`, `rot_within_rpy_bounds`): the
  singularity threshold was far too wide (`1e-3`), snapping pitch to ±90° up to
  ~2.5° early and discarding up to 0.04 rad of rotation. This made `contains()`
  reject poses that `sample()` produced. Tightened to a true-singularity
  threshold; round-trip error dropped from ~0.04 to ~1e-13.
- **`StablePlacer.place_mesh` seating**: objects whose center of mass is not at
  the object-frame origin floated above or sank through the table. The resting
  face now sits at `z = 0` for any COM.
- **`wrap_to_interval`** now guarantees a result in `[lower, lower + 2π)` (a
  floating-point modulo artifact could return exactly `lower + 2π`).
- **`TSRChain.distance`** no longer crashes on outer (wrapping) rotation
  intervals, and a single-TSR chain's `contains()` uses the exact closed-form
  check instead of the optimiser.
- Degenerate meshes (fewer than 4 points, coplanar) raise a clear `ValueError`
  instead of a raw SciPy `QhullError`.
- `grasp_*(k=0)` raises `ValueError` instead of `IndexError`; reversed
  `angle_range` raises instead of silently collapsing yaw freedom.

### Internal
- The pure-math core (`TSR`, `TSRChain`, SE(3) helpers) moved to a `tsr.core`
  subpackage; deep imports such as `from tsr.tsr import TSR` still work via
  back-compat shims.
- Added property-based tests (`hypothesis`) covering the core consistency
  contract, serialization round-trips, and the factory invariants; added an
  architecture-enforcement test (`tsr.core` has no upward imports; `import tsr`
  pulls no heavy viz dependencies).
- Added `docs/REVIEW.md` (pre-release review) and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- Removed the dead top-level `templates/` duplicate and the vestigial
  `MANIFEST.in` (hatchling bundles the packaged `tsr/templates/` automatically).

[2.0.0]: https://github.com/personalrobotics/tsr/releases/tag/v2.0.0
