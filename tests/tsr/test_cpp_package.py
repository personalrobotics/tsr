"""The C++ core is findable, and its copied constants still match the Python's (#165).

``cpp/`` is a second implementation of the rules in ``src/tsr/core/``. Agreement on
*behaviour* is the conformance corpus, checked by ctest; this file covers the two things
a C++ test cannot see:

* the package is **findable** — a planner locates the headers and the CMake package by
  asking the interpreter, so those entry points have to work from a wheel and say
  something useful from a checkout;
* the handful of **constants the C++ necessarily restates** still equal the Python's. A
  tolerance that drifts does not fail the corpus — it fails much later, as two
  implementations disagreeing about a boundary case, which is the failure mode #162 made
  `FRAME_ATOL` public to prevent.
