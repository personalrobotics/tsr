# The C++ core

`cpp/` is a second implementation of the pose region in `src/tsr/core/tsr.py` and the chain in
`src/tsr/core/tsr_chain.py`, for a planner that needs TSRs in C++ without paying a Python call
per edge sample.

**The Python is the source of truth for the rules.** They are stated in
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md); the C++ is held to them by a checked-in corpus of the
Python's own answers. Neither implementation reads the other.

## Using it

From C++, ask the installed Python package where the CMake package is — the same pattern
`sscbirrt` already uses for `ssik_cpp`:

```cmake
find_package(Python COMPONENTS Interpreter)
execute_process(
  COMMAND "${Python_EXECUTABLE}" -c "import tsr; print(tsr.get_cmake_dir(), end='')"
  OUTPUT_VARIABLE TSR_CMAKE_DIR RESULT_VARIABLE rc ERROR_QUIET)
if(rc EQUAL 0 AND TSR_CMAKE_DIR)
  list(APPEND CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH "${TSR_CMAKE_DIR}")
endif()
find_package(sstsr_cpp CONFIG REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(my_planner PRIVATE sstsr::sstsr_cpp)
```

```cpp
#include "sstsr/tsr.hpp"

sstsr::Bounds6 Bw{};
Bw.rows[0] = {-0.05, 0.05};
Bw.rows[5] = {-M_PI, M_PI};
const sstsr::TSR region(T0_w, Tw_e, Bw);

if (!region.contains(pose)) {
  const auto [distance, closest] = region.closest_transform(pose);
}
```

A chain composes several regions. Sampling hands back the coordinates that built the pose, and
those coordinates are a *constructive witness*: membership is then one bounds check and one
composition, with no optimiser involved.

```cpp
#include "sstsr/tsr_chain.hpp"

const sstsr::TSRChain chain({hinge, handle});   // only the first link's T0_w is read

sstsr::Rng rng(7);
const sstsr::ChainSample s = chain.sample_with_witness(rng);
assert(chain.validate_witness(s.pose, s.coordinates));

// Along a planner edge the neighbouring state's coordinates are a witness already, so the
// solve takes the exact path: nfev == 0, starts == 0, no search.
const auto result = chain.solve(s.pose, {.initial_guess = neighbour});
```

`cpp/examples/consumer` and `cpp/examples/wheel_consumer` are working versions of both
routes, and are run in CI.

## Two packagings, one config

The wheel stays `py3-none-any`. It carries the C++ **sources and headers**, not a
compiled library, so a consumer compiles them into its own build. That keeps one
artifact, one release pipeline and one install story.

| | consumed how | targets file | version |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cmake --install` of `cpp/` | `find_package(sstsr_cpp)` on the install prefix | exported by CMake; a real static library | **none** |
| the `sstsr` wheel | `find_package` on `tsr.get_cmake_dir()` | `cpp/cmake/sstsr_cppWheelTargets.cmake`, hand-written and relocatable; an `INTERFACE` target carrying the sources | the release version |

Both go through the one `cpp/cmake/sstsr_cppConfig.cmake.in`. The wheel needs its own
targets file because an exported one holds absolute paths from the machine that built it,
while a wheel lands wherever the virtualenv is. `hatch_build.py` renders it, and
`cpp/examples/wheel_consumer` is the only thing that reads it — including the version
file, which is why that example asks `find_package` for a version.

### Only the wheel states a version (#175)

`project()` in `cpp/CMakeLists.txt` declares no `VERSION`, and a source install ships no
`ConfigVersion` file. That is deliberate. The version comes from the git tag through
hatch-vcs — [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md) puts it plainly, *"Do not edit a version number
anywhere; there is none to edit"* — so a bare checkout has no version to state and a literal
here could only be stale. It was, and it made this the one hand-maintained version in the
repository: a source install said `3.2.0` while the wheel said `3.2.1`.

So:

```cmake
find_package(sstsr_cpp CONFIG REQUIRED)        # works from either packaging
find_package(sstsr_cpp 3.3 CONFIG REQUIRED)    # works from the wheel; from a source
                                               # install, fails with "version: unknown"
```

Failing is the point. A consumer that needs the chain pins a version, and answering it with a
stale number from a checkout while the installed wheel answers differently is the one outcome
worth preventing — it passes in development and fails on install. If you need to pin, consume
the wheel; `tests/tsr/test_cpp_package.py` holds both halves of this in place.

`get_cmake_dir()` raises from an editable install: only a built wheel carries the CMake
package. Configure `cpp/` directly in that case, as `cpp/examples/consumer` does.

## No dependencies, on purpose

Standard library only, C++20. A 4×4 transform is `std::array<double, 16>` row-major and
the generator is `std::mt19937_64`. A consumer that wants a TSR should not inherit a
linear-algebra dependency to hold a pose, and that is also what lets
`sstsr_cppConfig.cmake` carry no `find_dependency` at all. If that stops being true, that
config file is the first thing that has to change.

## What the two implementations agree on

Everything in the region, checked on 162 probes across 9 regions, and the forward half of the
chain, checked on 72 coordinate probes, 48 witness probes and 18 exact solves across 8 chains
(`tests/reference/tsr_conformance.json`, generated by `tools/tsr_conformance.py`, verified
by `cpp/tests/test_conformance.cpp`):

| | tolerance | why |
|---|---|---|
| the continuous-bounds chart, `volume`, the chain's chart and midpoint | `1e-12` | arithmetic on the inputs |
| `contains`, `is_valid`, `validate_witness`, a solve's `status`, `nfev` and `starts`, and whether a closest pose is itself contained | exact | verdicts and counters |
| `distance`, `closest_transform`, the chain's `to_transform` and recovered coordinates | `1e-9` | through `asin`/`atan2` and a nine-candidate minimum |
| any **geodesic residual** | `1e-7` | see below |

A geodesic residual needs the looser floor, and not for sloppiness. Its rotation term is
`acos((trace − 1) / 2)`, and `acos` is infinitely steep at 1: for two poses that agree to the
last bit, a 1-ulp error in the trace is reported as `acos(1 − 2.2e-16) = 2.1e-08` of angle, and
merely re-associating an algebraically identical product moves it by up to `4.2e-08`. So a
near-zero residual is only meaningful to about `1e-7`, and comparing one at `1e-9` would fail on
a different libm while nothing was wrong. `RESIDUAL_ATOL` in the generator and `kResidualTol` in
the C++ test are the same number for this reason.

The constants the C++ necessarily restates — `kFrameAtol`, `kEpsilon`, `kGimbalEpsilon`,
`kDefaultMaxStarts`, `kDefaultMaxNfev` — are checked against the Python's in
`tests/tsr/test_cpp_package.py`, which also pins the chain's default tolerance to `kEpsilon`
rather than a third copy of `0.001`, and pins the Python's geodesic rotation weight at 1.0 since
the C++ omits that parameter. A drifting constant does not fail the corpus; it fails much later,
as two implementations disagreeing about a boundary case.

## What they do not agree on, and why

**Sampling draws from a different engine.** `sstsr::unit` takes the top 53 bits of
`std::mt19937_64` directly, because the standard library's distributions differ between
libstdc++ and libc++; numpy's `Generator` is a different engine again. So a seeded sample
is reproducible *within* an implementation, not across the two. Sampling is therefore
checked as a property — in bounds, and contained — not against recorded coordinates. The
corpus records `sample_xyzrpy_seed7_python` for reference; nothing asserts against it.

**A chain's cold inverse is specified by properties, not by numbers.** The chain is therefore
split in two halves, and only one of them is in the corpus.

The forward half **is** exactly specifiable, and all of it is checked: the continuous chart,
`to_transform`, the witness path (`sample_with_witness`, `validate_witness`), the argument
validation, and the `solve` paths that reach an answer without searching — an empty chain, a
warm validating witness, a single link, an all-fixed chain, and `max_starts == 0` — including
their `nfev == 0, starts == 0` accounting.

The **cold** inverse is not. `solve` reports the best point found by L-BFGS-B, and "best" is
taken over the optimiser's iterates *plus* its `epsilon=1e-8` finite-difference probes. A
different optimiser evaluates a different set of points, so its `status`, `residual`,
`coordinates` and `nfev` differ with no bound relating them beyond "both are ≥ the true
minimum". That is already the documented position — `ChainSolveResult.residual` is an upper
bound and not a certified distance, and `"not_found"` is not a proof of non-membership (issue
#85) — so it is a property of the problem, not of the code.

So the cold half is held to properties instead: `nfev <= max_nfev` strictly,
`starts <= max_starts`, `residual == geodesic_distance(to_transform(coordinates), T)`,
coordinates within the chart, `"satisfied" ⟹ residual < tolerance`, and run-to-run determinism
within one implementation.

Three of those properties carry a **documented exception**, each because the Python genuinely
behaves that way and the corpus pins it:

| exception | why |
|---|---|
| `"satisfied" ⟹ residual < tolerance` holds only for two or more links | the single-link path never re-checks the tolerance. `contains` grants `kEpsilon` of slack per coordinate while the forward map clips to the chart, so it can report `satisfied` with a residual at or above tolerance — measured up to `2.4e-3` against a `1e-3` tolerance |
| the single-link `not_found` residual is not a geodesic | it is the region's 6-vector displacement norm. The two coincide for a pure translation or a single-axis rotation and diverge otherwise — `3.464` against a geodesic of `1.435` for a three-axis rotation |
| the warm path's coordinates need not lie in the chart | they are returned **verbatim**, un-canonicalised. A guess `9e-4` past a zero-width bound still passes `is_valid`, so it validates and comes back outside the chart. The residual is still the geodesic at those coordinates, because the forward map reapplies the chart |

"Correcting" any of these inside the port would make the two implementations disagree. If they
are worth changing, they are worth changing in the Python first.

The interior start-schedule fill also differs. The Python fills from numpy's `default_rng(0)`
(PCG64) and the C++ from its own `Rng` (`mt19937_64`), for the same reason sampling differs.
Porting PCG64 would buy nothing, because a different optimiser takes a different trajectory from
identical starts anyway. The starts that *are* specifiable — a canonicalised guess, the midpoint,
the two opposite corners — are arithmetic on the chart and agree.

One existing test cannot cross over:
`test_deterministic_counterexample_witness_certifies_membership` asserts that the cold solve
**fails** on a pose that is provably a member. It pins a property of scipy's trajectory, and our
projected Levenberg–Marquardt *solves* that pose — so a port would fail that test while being
more correct. It stays Python-only.

### The cold inverse

`cpp/src/chain_solver.hpp` is **projected Levenberg–Marquardt with an analytic Jacobian**. It is
internal — under `src/`, not `include/` — because a consumer calls `TSRChain::solve`; it is a
header so the test can check the Jacobian against central differences.

Why least squares, and not an approximation of the Python's objective but the same one:
`3 − tr(AᵀB) = ‖A − B‖²_F / 2` for `A, B ∈ SO(3)`, so the Python's scalar
`Δt·Δt + (3 − tr(RᵀR′))` **is** `‖r‖²` for the 12-vector `r = [Δt, (R − R′)/√2]`.

Two details are load-bearing, each established by ablation rather than assumed:

| removed | `rotation_rich` recall | mean evaluations |
|---|---|---|
| nothing (as implemented) | **40/40** | 95.7 |
| the analytic Jacobian, finite differences instead | 18/40 *(measured in the Python prototype)* | — |
| the gradient projection | **17/40** | 1206, i.e. budget-bound |

The gradient projection holds a coordinate pinned at a bound whose gradient pushes further out,
which is what keeps a rank-deficient direction at RPY gimbal lock from stalling the whole solve.
Dropping it also costs `two_yaws_and_a_slide` 4× the evaluations (191.5 against 44.4) while still
finding every pose, so recall alone does not show how much it does.

It finds the pose the Python's cold solve cannot — the deterministic counterexample of issue #85,
solved on the first start in 21 evaluations at a residual of `1.4e-17`. That is the concrete
reason `test_deterministic_counterexample_witness_certifies_membership` cannot cross over: it
asserts the cold solve **fails** on a provable member, so it pins SciPy's trajectory rather than
any rule. Being better is still not a licence to record cold results in the corpus — `not_found`
is not a proof of non-membership in either implementation.

What the properties do **not** cover, and why that is the honest state rather than an omission:
the projected step's clamp is not load-bearing for correctness. `coords_of` runs every point
through the chart map, so the returned coordinates cannot leave the chart whether or not the step
was clamped; the clamp keeps `x` and the evaluated point the same point, which costs convergence
when removed, not correctness.

One property that looks true and is not: **the reported residual is not monotone in the budget.**
The search minimises the chordal objective because it is smooth, and reports the geodesic at
whichever point won. Those are different orderings, so a later evaluation can lower `‖r‖²` and
raise the geodesic. The objective *is* monotone, and that is what the test asserts — the Python
has the same property for the same reason.

The recall floor (≥90% aggregate, ≥85% per chain, against a measured 160/160) writes
`chain_properties_report.txt` into the build directory as its inspectable artifact. Reproduce it
with `ctest --test-dir build -R tsr_chain`.

## Working on it

```bash
cmake -S cpp -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release && cmake --build build -j
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure

uv run python tools/tsr_conformance.py            # regenerate the corpus
uv run python tools/tsr_conformance.py --check    # still the same answers?

./cpp/examples/consumer/smoke.sh                  # the installed package
./cpp/examples/wheel_consumer/smoke.sh            # the package inside a wheel
```

Changing a rule means changing the Python, regenerating the corpus, and following it in
the C++ — in that order, so the diff shows which answers moved.

Adding a source file to `cpp/src/` means naming it in **two** places: `add_library` in
`cpp/CMakeLists.txt`, and `INTERFACE_SOURCES` in `cpp/cmake/sstsr_cppWheelTargets.cmake`.
`hatch_build.py` needs no change — it maps `cpp/include` and `cpp/src` as whole directories — and
that asymmetry is the trap: the wheel *ships* a file it does not *compile*, so forgetting the
second place produces an undefined symbol in a consumer and nowhere else.
`cpp/examples/consumer/main.cpp` is what catches it, because `wheel_consumer` compiles the same
file through the wheel's package.
